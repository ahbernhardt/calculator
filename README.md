# JavaScript Calculator

This is the fourth project of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) - Front End Libraries Certification - and I used [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for building this application.

## Objective

- Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app or other framework that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wgGVVX>. 

- Fulfill the [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) and get all the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
- Mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project.
